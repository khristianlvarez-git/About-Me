## 🚀 About Me 

I am a data analyst with strong technical foundations in SQL, Python, R, and data visualization, focused on transforming large, complex datasets into actionable insights that support business and operational decision-making. My background spans analytics projects in healthcare operations, sales and marketing analytics, customer segmentation, and sentiment analysis, with experience working on both structured and unstructured data at scale.

I have formal training in data analytics through the Postgraduate-level (Level 7) Career Accelerator in Data Analytics (with Distinction) at the London School of Economics and Political Science, where I completed intensive, project-based work integrating analytics with real-world decision contexts.

### *Core tools and technologies:*

  
- SQL (PostgreSQL): complex joins, aggregations, CTEs, data modeling
- Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- R: statistical analysis and data visualization
- Data Visualization: Tableau, Power BI
- Workflow & Reproducibility: Git/GitHub, Jupyter Notebooks, Anaconda
- Analytics Methods: regression analysis, clustering (k-means), sentiment analysis, exploratory data analysis (EDA)

### *Applied Analytics Experience*

#### Large-Scale Data Analysis

- Processed and analyzed 27 million NHS appointment records using Python
- Conducted exploratory data analysis to identify operational bottlenecks
- Built visualizations with Matplotlib and Seaborn to surface temporal and capacity patterns
- Modeled staffing optimization scenarios to support reductions in waiting times

#### SQL & Business Analytics

- Queried large PostgreSQL sales datasets to:
- Identify revenue trends and customer segments
- Analyze demographic performance across advertising channels
- Support marketing and sales strategy decisions
- Designed interactive Tableau dashboards to communicate insights clearly to non-technical stakeholders
  
#### Statistical Modeling & Machine Learning

- Built multi-linear regression models to analyze sales–marketing relationships
- Applied k-means clustering for customer and client segmentation
- Conducted sentiment analysis on online reviews to extract customer feedback signals and generate actionable recommendations


### *Analytics Mindset & Strengths*

#### Beyond tools, I bring a strong analytical mindset grounded in:
- Translating ambiguous business questions into structured analytical problems
- Working end-to-end: data cleaning → analysis → visualization → insight
- Communicating results clearly through dashboards and written insights
- Designing analyses that are reproducible, scalable, and decision-oriented


#### *My prior professional experience strengthens my ability to contextualize data, understand stakeholder needs, and align analytics outputs with operational or strategic goals—an essential skill for effective data analysts.*
